Simple LED functions with asynchronous capabilities.

= Methods =

*!LedControl.turnOn*(pin)

 Turn the LED on.

 * *pin*: Pin where the LED is connected.

*!LedControl.turnOn*(pin, delayMilliseconds)

 Turn the LED on smoothly like a "fade in" effect. *Depends on PWM*.

 * *pin*: Pin where the LED is connected.
 * *delayMilliseconds*: Time in milliseconds to become completely power-on.

*!LedControl.turnOff*(pin)

 Turn the LED off.

 * *pin*: Pin where the LED is connected.

*!LedControl.turnOff*(pin, delayMilliseconds)

 Turn the LED off smoothly like a "fade out" effect. *Depends on PWM*.

 * *pin*: Pin where the LED is connected.
 * *delayMilliseconds*: Time in milliseconds to become completely power-off.

*!LedControl.turnPercent*(pin, percent)

 Set a custom power level for a LED. *Depends on PWM*.

 * *pin*: Pin where the LED is connected.
 * *percent*: Level of power from 0 to 100.

*!LedControl.blink*(pin, times, intervalMilliseconds)

 Blinks the LED.

 * *pin*: Pin where the LED is connected.
 * *times*: Times to blink.
 * *intervalMilliseconds*: Interval between blinks in miliseconds.

*!LedControl.blink*(pin, times, intervalMilliseconds, delayMilliseconds)

 Blinks the LED smoothly with "fade in" and "fade out" effect. *Depends on PWM*.

 * *pin*: Pin where the LED is connected.
 * *times*: Times to blink.
 * *intervalMilliseconds*: Interval between blinks in miliseconds.
 * *delayMilliseconds*: Time in milliseconds to become completely power-on and power-off.

*!LedControl.startBlink*(pin, intervalMilliseconds)

  Start blinking the LED asynchronous.

 * *pin*: Pin where the LED is connected.
 * *intervalMilliseconds*: Interval between blinks in miliseconds.

*!LedControl.startBlink*(pin, intervalMilliseconds, delayMilliseconds)

  Start blinking the LED asynchronous with with "fade in" and "fade out" effect. *Depends on PWM*.

 * *pin*: Pin where the LED is connected.
 * *intervalMilliseconds*: Interval between blinks in miliseconds.
 * *delayMilliseconds*: Time in milliseconds to become completely power-on and power-off.

*!LedControl.stopBlink*(pin)

 Stop any asynchronous blinking.

 * *pin*: Pin where the LED is connected.

*!LedControl.loop*()

 Event handler process loop. Must be added to main '*loop*()' function to enable asynchronous capabilities.

= Comments =

 Don't forget to check the capable ports for PWM functions.

 The *!LedControl.loop*() function is needed only to enable asynchronous functions, in this case avoid using any blocking function in main '*loop*()'.

= Example =

 In this example two LEDs blinking together in different manners. At pin 9 is configured to 500ms of fade in/out with 1s of interval, and at pin 8 is a simple blinker with 200ms of interval:

{{{
#include <LedControl.h>

void setup() {
  LedControl.startBlink(9,1000,500);
  LedControl.startBlink(8,200);
}

void loop() {
  LedControl.loop();
}
}}}
